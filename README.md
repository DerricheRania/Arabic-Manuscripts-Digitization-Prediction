# Arabic-Manuscripts-Digitization-Prediction

**🕌 Arabic Manuscript Digitization**

**📘 Overview**

This project focuses on digitizing Arabic manuscripts by converting handwritten Arabic text into machine-readable text using Deep Learning techniques. Originally developed as part of my Final Year Project (PFE), the goal was to build an end-to-end AI model capable of recognizing and transcribing Arabic handwriting with high accuracy.

**🧠 Project Background**

Arabic manuscripts represent a vast cultural and scientific heritage, but most of them remain in handwritten form, making them difficult to access, search, and analyze. This project aims to bridge that gap by applying AI-based handwriting recognition to transform scanned manuscript images into editable text.

**🚀 From PFE to Datahon Challenge**

Interestingly, this same idea was later introduced as a Datahon challenge, where participants were tasked with developing an AI solution for Arabic manuscript recognition. Since my PFE project already addressed this problem, I participated by leveraging my pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on the new dataset provided during the Datahon.

The model performed effectively on this new data, proving its adaptability and robustness when applied to real-world handwritten Arabic manuscripts.

**⚙️ Technical Details**

Model Type: Deep Learning-based OCR (CNN + LSTM architecture)

Task: Handwritten Arabic text recognition

Datasets:

    - PFE custom dataset (curated and manually labeled)

    - Datahon challenge dataset (for additional training and testing)

Languages: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Output: Digitized Arabic text extracted from manuscript images

**🧩 Key Features**

- Robust to various handwriting styles and image qualities

- Preprocessing pipeline for noise removal and contrast enhancement

- Fine-tuned model for improved generalization

- High transcription accuracy

- Ready for integration into digitization workflows or research tools

**🏆 Results**

The model achieved strong recognition accuracy in both academic (PFE) and competitive (Datahon) contexts, highlighting its potential to support Arabic cultural preservation and digital archiving efforts.
